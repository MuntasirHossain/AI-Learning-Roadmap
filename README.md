# AI-Learning-Roadmap

In this learning roadmap I will share the steps I have taken so far, to improve my path to AI learning journey. I am creating this repository to enrich my experience and keep track of my progress. As there are a lot of topics to cover I will try to make it as simple as possible so that in future anyone can take a glimpse of it and get the idea.

## Mathematics:
1. Algebra:
   - Exponent Rules
   - Factoring
   - Functions
   - Graphs and equations
  
## Programming:
2. Python:
   - Strings, Integers
   - List
   - Dictionary
   - Recursion
       + There are three steps in recurstion:
             * Divide big problem into small and simple problems
             * Find a base condition with simple answer
             * Return or roll back answer for base condition to solve all sub problems
3. Data Structure in Python:
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Tree
       * General Tree
       * Binary Tree
       * Binary Search Tree
          + Build a Tree
          + Add Child Node
          + Traversal: In Order, Pre Order, Post Order
          + Search for a value
          + Determine tree depth
          + Find the maximum and minimum value
          + Delete a value from a tree
   - Graph
        
## Framework for Web Developement:
1. Laravel:
   - Laravel Basics
   - Frontend
   - Backend
  
## Version Control System:
1. Git
   - Basics of git
   - Commands:
     + Add
