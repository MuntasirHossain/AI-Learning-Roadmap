# AI-Learning-Roadmap

In this learning roadmap I will share the steps I have taken so far, to improve my path to AI learning journey. I am creating this repository to enrich my experience and keep track of my progress. As there are a lot of topics to cover I will try to make it as simple as possible so that in future anyone can take a glimpse of it and get the idea.

## Mathematics:
